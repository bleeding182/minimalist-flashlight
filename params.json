This is a minimal example, trying to make it as simple as possible.\r\n\r\n## Materials and Method\r\nThis project uses a *BroadcastReceiver* / *AppWidgetProvider* and a service to perform it's task. The state is persisted in a *SharedPreference*.\r\n\r\n## Extras\r\n\r\nAt [Flashlight Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bleeding182.flashlight) you can get the app for free on Android.",
