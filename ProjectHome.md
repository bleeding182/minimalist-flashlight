# Flashlight Widget #
Small and stable widget for android toggling the flash on/off.

## Introduction ##
The target was to make a small and stable widget for the android homescreen toggling the flashlight on and off, as most other flashlight apps have >1mb and / or ads and no activity is needed.

The code is commented and optimized to the best of my knowledge. This is a minimal example, trying to make it as simple as possible.

## Materials and Method ##
This project uses a _BroadcastReceiver_ / _AppWidgetProvider_ and a service to perform it's task. The state is persisted in a _SharedPreference_.

## Extras ##

At [Flashlight Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bleeding182.flashlight) you can get the app for Android.
