#Flashlight Widget for Android
Small and stable widget for android toggling the flash on/off.

##Introduction
The target was to make a small and stable widget for the android homescreen toggling the flashlight on and off, as most other flashlight apps have >1mb and / or ads and no activity is needed.

The code is commented and optimized to the best of my knowledge. This is a minimal example, trying to make it as simple as possible.

## Materials and Method
This project uses a *BroadcastReceiver* / *AppWidgetProvider* and a service to perform it's task. The state is persisted in a *SharedPreference*.

## Extras

At [Flashlight Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.bleeding182.flashlight) you can get the app for free on Android.
